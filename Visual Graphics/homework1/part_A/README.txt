A. Design a 3D scene (30 pts)
Using Three.js, create a scene with at least 3 objects and 3 lights.
— Each object will use a different shader, e.g., a Phong shader, a shader that applies a
texture, a vertex displacement shader, etc. At least one of the objects must both be
textured and react to lighting.
— Each object and light in the scene will move or rotate.
(Lucas will show you how to create and load in more complex shapes using Blender in this
week’s Lab sections. You can also use .obj files, for example, taken from the Google Poly
library.)
