Part A: 
	For my part A I created a angled landscape with a rock/mountain that vaugely resembles a volcano. The water rises up partially along this landscape and provides for a very pretty environment.

Part B:
	For my part B I created smoke. I attempted to do some actually creative sliders with the gui, but was unable to figure out how to change colors for the smoke texture. Overall I think it's pretty realistic.
