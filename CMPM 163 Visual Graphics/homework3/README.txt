This homework was easily one of the most difficult I've had to do yet. 
I spent upwards of 15 hours on part B debugging, restarting, and overall just 
getting frustrated. I'm very dissapointed in the project I managed to come up 
with, but I'm simply too tired and can't continue. I apologize for wasting your
time, but I tried my best to come up with what points I could. Thank you.
