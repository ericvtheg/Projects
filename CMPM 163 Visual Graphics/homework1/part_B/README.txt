Move mouse up and down to get effects.

Directions:
Using GLSL, create an shader that takes an image and applies an image processing
algorithm to it.
— Design an image processing shader of your choice using a filter kernel, such as one
described on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing).
— Add simple mouse or keyboard interactivity to increase or decrease the effect in some
way.
