D. Discuss a visual effect (10 pts)
Take a screenshot (or photo) of an interesting visual effect you noticed in a video game or
computational artwork. In a few paragraphs, describe the effect. What do you like about it?
How do you think it was created? Does the effect change depending on the camera view?
The lights? Is it an effect that updates the geometry itself, or change the color of the pixels,
or does it alter a texture?
