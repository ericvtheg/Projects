increase the price of Non-Fiction books by 1.50, and youâ€™ll increase the price of Fiction books by 2.50.

a) If thePublisherID published 3 or more books, then the prices of the most expensive 3 books that thePublisherID published should be increased.
b) If thePublisherID published only 2 books, then the prices of the most expensive 2 books that thePublisherID published should be increased.
c) If thePublisherID published no books, then there should be no price increases.
